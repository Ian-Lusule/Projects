# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains three simple Python projects: a number guesser game, a basic calculator, and a random password generator.  These projects are designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrate fundamental Python concepts.

## Project Description

This collection of mini-projects serves as a practical introduction to Python programming. Each project focuses on a specific task, allowing users to learn and practice core programming skills such as user input, conditional statements, loops, and random number generation.  The projects are designed to be easily understandable and modifiable, encouraging experimentation and further development.

## Features

### 1. Number Guesser

*   The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 (adjustable).
*   The user inputs guesses until they correctly guess the number.
*   Provides feedback after each guess ("Too high" or "Too low").
*   Keeps track of the number of attempts.

### 2. Basic Calculator

*   Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   Takes two numbers as input from the user.
*   Handles division by zero errors gracefully, displaying an appropriate message.
*   Displays the result of the calculation.

### 3. Random Password Generator

*   Generates a random password of a user-specified length.
*   Includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
*   Allows the user to customize the password length.
*   Provides a generated password that meets common password complexity requirements.


## Installation

No special installation is required.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  The code is self-contained and can be run directly using a Python interpreter.

## Usage

Each project is a separate Python file:

*   **number_guesser.py:** Run this file to play the number guessing game.
*   **calculator.py:** Run this file to use the basic calculator.
*   **password_generator.py:** Run this file to generate random passwords.

Simply navigate to the directory containing the relevant `.py` file in your terminal and run it using the command `python <filename>.py`.  Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with each program.
