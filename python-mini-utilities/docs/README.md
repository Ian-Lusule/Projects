# Python Mini-Projects

This repository contains three simple Python projects: a number guesser game, a basic calculator, and a random password generator.  These projects are designed to be beginner-friendly and demonstrate fundamental Python concepts.

## Project Description

This collection of mini-projects serves as a practical introduction to Python programming. Each project focuses on a specific task, allowing users to learn and practice core programming skills such as:

* **Input/Output:** Handling user input and providing feedback.
* **Control Flow:** Using conditional statements (if/else) and loops.
* **Functions:** Defining and using reusable blocks of code.
* **Error Handling:** Gracefully managing potential errors (e.g., division by zero).
* **Random Number Generation:** Utilizing the `random` module.
* **String Manipulation:** Working with strings and characters.


## Features

### 1. Number Guesser

* The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 (adjustable).
* The user inputs their guess.
* The program provides feedback ("Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!").
* The program keeps track of the number of guesses.

### 2. Basic Calculator

* Takes two numbers as input from the user.
* Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Handles division by zero with an appropriate error message.
* Displays the result of the calculation.

### 3. Random Password Generator

* Allows the user to specify the desired password length.
* Generates a random password containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* Provides the generated password to the user.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/Python-Mini-Projects.git
   ```
   Replace `[YourGitHubUsername]` with your actual GitHub username (if you're hosting it on GitHub).  If not, adjust the URL accordingly.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Python-Mini-Projects
   ```

3.  **No further installation is needed.**  The projects are pure Python and require no external libraries.


## Usage

Each project is a separate Python file:

* **`number_guesser.py`:** Run the number guesser game using `python number_guesser.py`.
* **`calculator.py`:** Run the basic calculator using `python calculator.py`.
* **`password_generator.py`:** Run the password generator using `python password_generator.py`.
