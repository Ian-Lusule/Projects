# Contributing to Python Mini Utilities

We welcome contributions to this project!  This document outlines how to contribute code, documentation, and report issues.

## Contributing Code

We encourage contributions of new mini-utilities or improvements to existing ones.  Here's how to contribute:

1. **Fork the repository:** Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for your contribution using a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-fibonacci-utility`, `bugfix/number-guesser-input-validation`).

3. **Make your changes:**  Implement your changes, following the coding style of the existing codebase.  Keep your changes focused and well-documented.

4. **Test your changes:**  Thoroughly test your changes to ensure they work correctly and don't introduce any regressions.  Add unit tests where appropriate.

5. **Commit your changes:**  Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages.  Follow the conventional commit format (e.g., `feat: add new utility`, `fix: address division by zero error`).

6. **Push your branch:**  Push your branch to your forked repository.

7. **Create a pull request:**  Create a pull request from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.  Clearly describe your changes in the pull request description.

## Contributing Documentation

Improving the documentation is just as important as contributing code.  If you find any inaccuracies or areas for improvement in the documentation, please submit a pull request with your changes.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the issue tracker.  Please provide as much detail as possible, including:

* **Steps to reproduce the issue:**  Provide clear and concise steps to reproduce the bug.
* **Expected behavior:**  Describe what you expected to happen.
* **Actual behavior:**  Describe what actually happened.
* **Environment:**  Specify your operating system, Python version, and any other relevant information.

## Coding Style

* Follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
* Use docstrings to document your code.
* Keep functions and classes concise and focused.
* Write unit tests for your code.

## Code of Conduct

We follow a code of conduct based on respect, inclusivity, and collaboration.  Please be mindful of this when interacting with the community.

## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing to open source projects, we encourage you to start with smaller tasks like fixing typos in the documentation or improving the existing unit tests.  We're happy to help you get started!  Feel free to open an issue asking for guidance.
