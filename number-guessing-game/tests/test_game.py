**To make this code runnable, you'll need:**

1.  **`number_guessing_game/game.py`:** This file should contain the actual implementation of your number guessing game.  It should have a function `guess_the_number(secret_number, guess)` that takes the secret number and the user's guess as input and returns an appropriate string indicating the result (e.g., "Too high!", "Too low!", "Congratulations!").  Here's an example:


```python
# number_guessing_game/game.py

def guess_the_number(secret_number, guess):
    """Plays a single round of the number guessing game.

    Args:
        secret_number: The number the user needs to guess.
        guess: The user's guess.

    Returns:
        A string indicating the result of the guess.  Raises ValueError for invalid input.
    """
    try:
        guess = int(guess) #Ensure guess is an integer
        if guess < 1 or guess > 100: #Example range check, adjust as needed
            raise ValueError("Guess out of range")
        if guess == secret_number:
            return f"Congratulations! You guessed the number in 1 try."
        elif guess < secret_number:
            return "Too low!"
        else:
            return "Too high!"
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid input: {e}") from None


```

2.  **Project Structure:**  Make sure your project directory is structured like this:

```
number-guessing-game-simple-calculator-app-to-do-l/
├── number-guessing-game/
│   ├── game.py
│   └── tests/
│       └── test_game.py
└── ... (other app components)
```

3.  **Install `unittest` (if not already installed):**  `unittest` is a built-in Python module, so you likely don't need to install it separately.

After setting up these components, you can run the tests using: `python -m unittest number-guessing-game/tests/test_game.py`


Remember to adapt the `guess_the_number` function and the tests to match the exact specifications and features of your game implementation.  The example provided assumes a simple guessing game with a limited range.  You might need to add more sophisticated tests to cover edge cases or more complex game logic.
