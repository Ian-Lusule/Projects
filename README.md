# Scripting, Penetration Testing, & Fun Code Projects

This repository serves as a collection of personal projects exploring various aspects of scripting, penetration testing, and, well, just plain fun code!  I'll be regularly updating this space with new projects as time allows.  Consider this a living document reflecting my ongoing learning and experimentation.

## Project Categories

### Scripting Projects

This section houses scripts written in various languages, focusing on automation, data manipulation, and system administration tasks.

* **Python:**
    * `network_scanner.py`: A simple network scanner written in Python using the `scapy` library.  Scans for open ports and services.
    * `file_organizer.py`: Automates the organization of files based on various criteria (e.g., file type, date created).
* **Bash:**
    * `backup_script.sh`: A bash script for automating backups of important files and directories.
* **Powershell:**
    * `active_directory_search.ps1`:  A Powershell script for querying Active Directory information.


### Penetration Testing Projects

This section contains projects focused on ethical hacking and security testing.  All projects are for educational purposes only and should not be used for illegal activities.

* **Network Mapping:** Exploration of Nmap and other network scanning tools.  Includes scripts for automating scans and analyzing results.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Experiments with OpenVAS and Nessus, focusing on identifying and understanding common vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Security:**  Projects focused on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, including XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF.  (Note:  These projects will involve simulated attacks against vulnerable web applications set up in a controlled environment).

### Fun Code Projects

This is where the creative coding happens!  Expect a mix of interesting and sometimes quirky projects.

* **Game Development (Pygame):**  Simple games built using the Pygame library.  Expect updates with new games and features.
* **Data Visualization (Matplotlib):**  Projects focusing on visualizing data using Matplotlib.  Expect visualizations of interesting datasets.
* **Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup):**  Projects focused on extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup.


## Planned Future Adventures

I'm excited to explore these areas in the future:

* **More advanced penetration testing techniques:**  Focusing on exploit development and post-exploitation techniques.
* **Machine learning for security:**  Exploring the use of machine learning in detecting and preventing security threats.
* **Developing a larger-scale project:**  Potentially a full-fledged application combining elements from multiple categories.
* **Contributing to open-source projects:**  Giving back to the community by contributing to existing projects.
