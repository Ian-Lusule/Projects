## Coding Style and Conventions

* **Language:**  The primary language is [Specify Language, e.g., Python].
* **Linting:** We use [Specify linter, e.g., Pylint] to enforce consistent code style. Please run the linter before submitting your pull request.  (Instructions on how to run the linter should be provided in a separate README or section).
* **Error Handling:**  All functions should include appropriate error handling.  Use try-except blocks to catch potential exceptions and handle them gracefully.  Log errors using a suitable logging library (e.g., Python's `logging` module).
* **Testing:**  Unit tests are crucial.  We use [Specify testing framework, e.g., pytest].  All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by comprehensive tests.  (Instructions on how to run tests should be provided in a separate README or section).
* **Documentation:**  Document your code using [Specify documentation style, e.g., docstrings].  Make sure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
* **Commit Messages:**  Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of your changes.  Follow the conventional commit message format (e.g.,  `feat: Add new feature`, `fix: Bug fix in module X`).
