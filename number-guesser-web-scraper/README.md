# Project: WeatherScraper

## Description

This project consists of a simple Python program that scrapes weather data from a specified website (currently using weather.com as an example) and displays it to the user.  This is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating basic web scraping techniques using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.  Future iterations could include more robust error handling, different data sources, and a more user-friendly interface.

## Features

* Scrapes current weather information (temperature, conditions, etc.) from weather.com.
* Displays the scraped data in a clear and concise format in the console.
* Uses `requests` for HTTP requests and `BeautifulSoup` for HTML parsing.
* (Future)  Error handling for website changes or network issues.
* (Future)  Support for multiple locations.
* (Future)  GUI interface.
