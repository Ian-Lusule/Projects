# Number Guesser Web Scraper API Documentation

This document outlines the API for the Number Guesser Web Scraper project.  This project combines a simple number guessing game with a web scraper for weather data (implementation details may vary depending on the chosen website).

## I. Number Guessing Game API

This section details the API for interacting with the number guessing game component.

**Endpoint:** `/guess` (POST request)

**Request Body:**

* `guess`: (integer) The player's guess for the number.

**Response (JSON):**

* `status`: (string)  Indicates the result of the guess. Possible values:
    * `"too_high"`: The guess was too high.
    * `"too_low"`: The guess was too low.
    * `"correct"`: The guess was correct.
* `guesses_remaining`: (integer) The number of guesses remaining.  (If applicable)
* `message`: (string) A message providing feedback to the player.


**Example Request (using curl):**

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"guess": 50}' http://localhost:8080/guess
```

**Example Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "status": "too_low",
  "guesses_remaining": 5,
  "message": "Try a higher number!"
}
```


## II. Web Scraper API (Weather Data)

This section details the API for retrieving weather data.  The specific implementation and endpoints will depend on the target website and scraping techniques used.  This is a placeholder and needs to be updated based on your actual implementation.

**Endpoint (Example - Replace with your actual endpoint):** `/weather` (GET request)

**Request Parameters (Example - Replace with your actual parameters):**

* `location`: (string) The location for which to retrieve weather data (e.g., "London", "New York").

**Response (JSON - Example - Replace with your actual response structure):**

```json
{
  "location": "London",
  "temperature": 15,
  "condition": "Cloudy",
  "wind_speed": 10
}
```

**Example Request (using curl - Replace with your actual endpoint and parameters):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/weather?location=London
```


**Note:**  Error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes should be implemented for both APIs.  The specific details of error responses are not included here but should be documented in a production-ready API.

This documentation is subject to change as the project evolves.
