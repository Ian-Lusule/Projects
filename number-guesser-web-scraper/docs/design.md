# Number Guesser Web Scraper - Design Document

This document outlines the design for a project combining a number guessing game with a simple web scraper.  The project will consist of two distinct, but potentially integrated, components:

**I. Number Guessing Game:**

* **Functionality:** A user will attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (e.g., 1-100).  The game will provide feedback after each guess (too high, too low, or correct).  The number of attempts will be tracked.
* **User Interface (UI):** A simple HTML interface with:
    * Input field for the user's guess.
    * Button to submit the guess.
    * Display area to show feedback (too high/low/correct) and the number of attempts.
    * Optionally, a "New Game" button to reset the game.
* **Technology:**  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used to create the game.  No backend is required for this component.
* **Data Storage:** No persistent data storage is needed; all game state is managed in the browser's memory.


**II. Web Scraper (Optional Integration):**

* **Functionality:** This component will scrape data from a publicly available website.  The specific target website will be determined, but a weather website is a good example. The scraper will extract relevant information such as temperature, conditions, and possibly wind speed.
* **Target Website:**  [Specify the target website URL here, if decided.  Otherwise, leave as "To be determined"].
* **Data Extraction:**  We will use a library like `Beautiful Soup` (Python) or a similar JavaScript library to parse the HTML of the target website and extract the desired data.
* **Data Handling:** The extracted data will be processed and formatted for display.  Error handling will be implemented to gracefully handle cases where data is unavailable or the website structure changes.
* **Integration with Number Guesser (Optional):**  The scraped weather data could be integrated into the number guessing game. For example, the range of the guessing game could be dynamically adjusted based on the temperature (e.g., a wider range on hotter days).  This integration is optional and its complexity will depend on the chosen website and desired integration level.
* **Technology:** Python with libraries like `requests` and `Beautiful Soup` (or a JavaScript equivalent if choosing a JavaScript-based scraper).


**III. Overall Architecture:**

The two components can be implemented independently.  Integration, if desired, will involve passing data from the web scraper to the number guessing game.  This could be done through a simple API (if using Python for both) or by embedding the scraped data directly into the HTML of the game (if using JavaScript for both).


**IV. Future Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling will be implemented in both components to handle unexpected situations (e.g., network errors, website changes, invalid user input).
* **Scalability:**  The current design is not intended for high scalability.  For a more scalable solution, a backend server and database would be required.
* **User Experience (UX):**  The UI will be designed for simplicity and ease of use.


This design document serves as a starting point and may be updated as the project progresses.
