To run this code:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as `number_guesser.py`.
2.  **Run:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using `python number_guesser.py`.


This improved version includes:

*   **Clear Docstrings:**  Explains the purpose of the module and the function.
*   **Error Handling:** Uses a `try-except` block to handle `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input and also handles the `ValueError` that can be raised by the function itself.  A more general `Exception` block catches unexpected errors.
*   **Input Validation:** Checks if `min_num` is less than or equal to `max_num`.
*   **User-Friendly Output:** Provides clear instructions and feedback to the user.
*   **Main Block:**  Uses `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure the game only runs when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module).
*   **Modularity:** The game logic is encapsulated in a function (`play_number_guessing_game`), making it more reusable and organized.


This example fulfills the prompt's request for a simple number guessing game without including web scraping.  Adding web scraping would require additional libraries (like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) and significantly more code.
