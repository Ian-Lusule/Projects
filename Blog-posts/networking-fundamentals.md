Networking is the backbone of the modern digital world. Understanding networking fundamentals is crucial for programmers and tech enthusiasts. This post provides a high-level overview of key concepts.

**The OSI Model**

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model standardizes telecommunication/computing system functions. It divides network communication into seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer:** Physical data transmission (cables, wireless).
2. **Data Link Layer:** Error detection/correction, data framing (Ethernet).
3. **Network Layer:** Data packet routing (IP addresses, routing protocols).
4. **Transport Layer:** Reliable/ordered data delivery (TCP, UDP).
5. **Session Layer:** Manages application connections.
6. **Presentation Layer:** Data formatting, encryption.
7. **Application Layer:** Network services for applications (HTTP, SMTP).

**Key Networking Concepts**

*   **IP Addresses:** Unique numerical labels for network devices (IPv4, IPv6).
*   **TCP/IP:** The internet's foundation (TCP for reliable delivery, IP for addressing/routing).
*   **DNS:** Translates domain names (e.g., `google.com`) to IP addresses.
*   **Routers:** Forward data packets between networks.
*   **Subnets:** Dividing networks into smaller segments.
*   **Firewalls:** Control network traffic based on rules.
*   **Ports:** Numbers identifying applications/services on a device.

**TCP vs. UDP**

TCP and UDP are transport layer protocols with key differences:

| Feature       | TCP                               | UDP                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Connection     | Connection-oriented               | Connectionless                       |
| Reliability    | Reliable                           | Unreliable                           |
| Ordering       | Ordered                           | Unordered                           |
| Overhead       | Higher                             | Lower                              |
| Example Uses   | Web browsing, file transfer       | Streaming, online gaming           |
